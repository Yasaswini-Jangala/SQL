PSEUDO COLUMNS
--------------
These are Virtual Columns which are present in each and every Table
	1. ROWID -> It has address of Record.
		    It contains exactly 18 characters
		    It is generated at the time of Insertion of new Record
		    It is Unique for each row/ record
		    It is static, It can't be renamed (or) deleted
			SELECT *
			FROM TABLE_NAME
			WHERE ROWID = 'ROW_ID_OF_RECORD'

		     
		SELECT ROWID, ROWNUM, TABLE_NAME.*
		FROM TABLE_NAME;

	2. ROWNUM -> It is a serial number given to each and every record.
		     It is generated at the time of execution
		     It is Unique
		     It is dynamic, because we can 
		     It always starts from 1
		     It
			SELECT TABLE_NAME.*, ROWNUM 
			FROM TABLE_NAME
			WHERE ROWNUM = INTEGER_VALUE;
				-> Here as the condition is static and there is no increment in INTEGER_VALUE, the row numbers are not assigned and we get output as "no rows selected" 
			SELECT ROWNUM, ROWID, EMP.*
			FROM TABLE_NAME
			WHERE <FILER_CONDITION>

			1. To make ROWNUM as Static
			SELECT *
			FROM (
				SELECT ROWNUM SLNO, TABLE_NAME.*
				FROM TABLE NAME
			) WHERE SLNO = INTEGER_VALUE;



First Half
SELECT * FROM (SELECT ROWNUM SLNO, EMP.* FROM EMP WHERE ROWNUM <= (SELECT COUNT(*)/2 AS MID
FROM EMP))
----------------
Second Half
SELECT ROWNUM, EMP.* FROM EMP
MINUS
SELECT * FROM (SELECT ROWNUM SLNO, EMP.* FROM EMP WHERE ROWNUM <= (SELECT COUNT(*)/2 AS MID FROM EMP
))
----------------
DELETE FROMTABLE_NAME
WHERE ROWID = (
		SELECT MAX(ROWID)
		FROM EMP3
		WHERE ENAME = 'SMITH'
	     );


Nth MAX Sal using 
		1. Arrange all distinct salaries in descending order
			SELECT DISTINCT SAL
			FROM EMP
			ORDER BY SAL;

		2. Select ROWNUM of all the distinct salaries
			SELECT ROWNUM SLNO, SAL
			FROM ( 
				SELECT DISTINCT SAL
				FROM EMP
				ORDER BY SAL
			);
			
		3.  
			SELECT SAL
			FROM (
				SELECT ROWNUM SLNO, SAL
				FROM (
					SELECT DISTINCT SAL
					FROM EMP
					ORDER BY SAL DESC
				     )
			     )
			WHERE SLNO IN (5,8);	

		4.  
			SELECT MAX(SAL)
			FROM (
				SELECT ROWNUM SLNO, SAL
				FROM (
					SELECT DISTINCT SAL
					FROM EMP
					ORDER BY SAL DESC
				     )
			     )
			WHERE SLNO IN (5, 8);	
			

Nth MIN Sal using 
		1. Arrange all distinct salaries in descending order
			SELECT DISTINCT SAL
			FROM EMP
			ORDER BY SAL;

		2. Select ROWNUM of all the distinct salaries
			SELECT ROWNUM SLNO, SAL
			FROM ( 
				SELECT DISTINCT SAL
				FROM EMP
				ORDER BY SAL
			);	
			
		3.  
			SELECT SAL
			FROM (
				SELECT ROWNUM SLNO, SAL
				FROM (
					SELECT DISTINCT SAL
					FROM EMP
					ORDER BY SAL
				     )
			     )
			WHERE SLNO = 8;	


		4.  
			SELECT MIN(SAL)
			FROM (
				SELECT ROWNUM SLNO, SAL
				FROM (
					SELECT DISTINCT SAL
					FROM EMP
					ORDER BY SAL
				     )
			     )
			WHERE SLNO IN (5, 8);	
			

DATA DICTONARY
--------------
Consists of Meta Data (TABLES, USER CONSTRAINTS, USER INDEXES, etc)

To display INDEXES
SELECT 
	TABLE_NAME,
	COLUMN_NAME,
	INDEX_NAME
	FROM ALL_IND_COLUMNS
	WHERE TABLE_OWNER = 'C##USER_NAME'
	
	

SELECT CONSTRAINT_NAME, CONSTRAINT_TYPE
FROM USER_CONSTRAINTS
WHERE TABLE_NAME = 'TABLE_NAME_1'

 UPDATE EMP
 	SET SAL = 0
 	WHERE EMPNO IN ( 
		SELECT EMPNO
			FROM (
			SELECT ROWNUM SLNO, EMP.* FROM EMP 
			WHERE ROWNUM <= 7)
	WHERE SLNO (3,5,7));
	

 UPDATE EMP
 SET SAL = 1
 WHERE EMPNO IN ( SELECT EMPNO FROM (SELECT ROWNUM SLNO, EMP.* FROM EMP) WHERE
 SLNO IN (3, 4, 5))
