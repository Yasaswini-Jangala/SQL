SQL(Structured Query Language) is a Backend Language.

The 3 Level Architecture
_______________________
	Physical Level
	Logical Level
	View Level

Front End Languages -> HTML, CSS, JS
Back End Languages -> C, Python, Java, SQL.

Purpose of SQL
______________
To Validate, Store Data and Communicate with Data Base.

Data -> Data is a raw fact which describes the attributes (or) properties of an entity (or) object.
Data Base -> DB is a place (or) medium where we can store data in systematic order and organised manner.

CRUD operations
_______________
	C -> CREATE, INSERT
	R -> READ, RETRIEVAL
	U -> UPDATE, MODIFY
	D -> DELETE, DROP.

(DBMS)Data Base Management System
_________________________________
DBMS is a software which is used to maintain and manage the Data Base.
It provides 2 main features to Data Base, They are 
	1. Security
	2. Authorization

In Data Base data is stored in form of files. For each new data, we need each file, so Accessing (or) Retrieval is hard, takes much time and Space consumption is high.
To communicate with DBMS we use Query Language.

To solve this problem, we use (RDBMS)Relational Data Base Management System.
RDBMS is a type of DBMS software which is used to manage, maintain the Data Base. 
It stores data in form of Tables.
It provides main features like
	1. Security
	2. Authorization.
To communicate with RDBMS we use SQL.

Relational Data Base Management System -> Tables which have relations.
______________________________________

Relational Model -> 
________________
Rows or Tuples or Records
Columns or Attributes or Fields or Properties
Cell is the smallest unit of a table, It is the intersection of a row and a column, generates space which is called as cell.
  
It consists of some rules which helps us to store data in the form of Tables.
Edgarad Frankk Codd introduced these rules, There are 12 rules which are later combined into 4 rules.
Any DBMS System which follows these Relational Model rules is known as RDBMS

Rules of EF Codd
________________
	1. Data entered into a cell must be single valued.
	2. Using RDBMS, we can store everything in the form of tables it includes metadata. 
		Meta Data -> The further details about the data is called Meta Data, it is auto generated.
	3. Using RDBMS, we can store data into multiple tables and if necessary we can establish connection between the tables using the key attributes.
	4. The data entered into  a table/cell/column must be validated in 2 ways, they are
		1. By assigning Data Types
		2. By assigning Constraints.

Data Types
__________
Data Types are used to specify what type of data can be stored in a particular column (or) location.
There are 5 Data Types, They are
	1. CHAR(SIZE)
		It is Used to store character values (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, AaBb, !@#$%^&*()_+-=<>?:"{}|,./;'[]\)
		It is mandatory to mention the characters in ''
		SIZE accepts up to 2000 characters
		It follows fixed length memory allocation. 
	2. VARCHAR(SIZE)
		It is Used to store character values (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, AaBb, !@#$%^&*()_+-=<>?:"{}|,./;'[]\)
		It is mandatory to mention the characters in ''
		SIZE accepts up to 2000 characters
		It follows variable length memory allocation. 
	3. VARCHAR2(SIZE)
		It is Used to store character values (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, AaBb, !@#$%^&*()_+-=<>?:"{}|,./;'[]\)
		It is mandatory to mention the characters in ''
		SIZE accepts up to 4000 characters
		It follows variable length memory allocation. 
	4. DATE
		It is Used to store data in the given oracle specified format
		It is mandatory to mention the date in ''
		It has 2 formats, They are
			1. 'DD-MON-YYYY'
			2. 'DD-MON-YY'
	5. NUMBER(PRECISION, [SCALE])
		It consists of 2 arguments, They are
			1. PRECISION
			2. SCALE
		PRECISION -> It is used to store the integer values in the range (1 to 38)
		SCALE -> It is used store/give decimal values in the range (-84 to 127), SCALE is optional
			NUMBER(5) -> ±99999
			NUMBER(5,2) -> ±999.99
			NUMBER(2,5) -> ±000.99
			NUMBER(5,5) -> ±.99999
	6. LARGE OBJECTS
		It stores huge amount of data, stores up to 4GB of memory.
		It is of 2 types, They are
			1. CHAR LARGE OBJECT (CLO) -> It stores character values up to 4GB.
			2. BINARY LARGE OBJECT (BLO) -> It stores binary values up to 4GB.

Constraints -> These are the rules given to a column or assigned to a column to validate the data
___________
	We have 5 Constraints
		1. CHECK
			It is used to check a condition and assign value.
			It is a constraint provided with a specific condition, If the condition is satisfied data is stored and If the condition fails data is rejected.
				CHECK(AGE>=20)
		2. UNIQUE
			It is used to avoid duplicated values into a column, It wont allow to insert duplicates. 
		3. NOT NULL
			It is used to avoid NULL values into a column, 'NULL' is a string and is accepted.
		4. PRIMARY KEY
			It is used to identify a record uniquely from a Table.
			Characteristics of Primary Key are
				1. No duplicate values are allowed.
				2. NULL values are not allowed.
				3. It is the combination of UNIQUE and NOT NULL.
				4. A table can have only 1 column as a primary key.
		5. FOREIGN KEY
			It is used to identify a record's data uniquely from another Table.
			It is used to establish connection between 2 Tables.
			Characteristics of Foreign Key are
				1. Duplicate values are allowed.
				2. NULL values are allowed.
				3. It is not a combination of UNIQUE and NOT NULL.
				4. A table can have more than 1 column as a foreign key.
				5. If a column wants to be a be a foreign key, it must be a Primary key in its own table or in the parent table.
				6. It is also known as Referential Integrity Constraint.
